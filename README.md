# Lights Out
Project developed during the Tokyo Blocks Hackathon 2017. It was developed using a [Lightpad Block](https://roli.com/products/blocks/lightpad-block) and a Control Block by [ROLI](https://roli.com/), and the [JUCE](https://www.juce.com/) API to control them.

Lights Out is a puzzle game that requires the player to turn off all the lights in the surface of the Lightpad device. When pressing a "button", its light status will toggle, as well as the status of all adjacent "buttons".

## Features
- Stage selection implemented with the numeric buttons of the Control block.
- Scrolling "YOU WIN" screen after clearing a puzzle.
